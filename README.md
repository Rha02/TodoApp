# Project Planner
This is a project planner web application I've been working on.

The backend uses the PHP framework **Laravel** and it runs on this domain: "todoapp.loc/"

The frontend uses the **VueJS** framework and it runs on "localhost:8080/"

## Packages installed:
**Tailwind CSS** - for easier and prettier web design

**jwt-auth** - creating a secure connection between the backend and the frontend
